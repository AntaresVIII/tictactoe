# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It's a learning project that is part of the **JavaScript curriculum** in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

- Modular programming with IIFE and factory functions
- DOM manipulation
- Game state management
- Form validation
- Responsive layout and basic CSS styling

## How it works

- Two players enter their names and click "Start Game".
- They take turns until one wins or the game ends in a draw.
- A result message is displayed at the end of the game.
- The "Reset" button clears the board and allows a new game.
